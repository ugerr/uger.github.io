I am Canming Yao (姚灿明 in Chinese), currently working as an assistant engineer at [Guangdong Institute of Intelligence Science and Technology](https://gdiist.cn/) (Gdiist, China), responsible for developing a compilation toolchain for brain-inspired chips. I received my M.S. degree at [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/) in 2023 and my B.E. degree at [China University of Geosciences, Wuhan](https://www.cug.edu.cn/) in 2020.

My recent work mainly focuses on:

* **Brain-Inspired AI Compilers R&D**
  * **Compilation Toolchain Development**: Engineered a toolchain to compile AI models and operator libraries into executable code for brain-inspired chips
  * **Software-Hardware Co-Design**: Devised architectures for software-hardware collaboration in neuromorphic chips
* **Cross-domain Computer Vision**
  * **Object Recognition/Detection** in[ Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic-aperture_radar) images (postgraduate research)
  * **Optical Flow Estimation** (Huawei 2012 Laboratories internship).
